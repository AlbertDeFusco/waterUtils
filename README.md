water.py - Fix the geometry of each water molecule to the gas-phase reference geometry
   1. this python script reads in a water cluster in XYZ format, 
   2. finds the euler angles for each water molecule to determine its position and direction in the global frame
   3. rotates the standard gas-phase reference geometry to the global frame for each water moleucle
